# led_cube_snake
Run the computer game classic on the surface of a cube surface stuffed with 16x16 led panels on 5 sides.

The snake game is controlled via serial interface commands. While this project shall provide a Platformio project (Arduino libs for Led Matrix control) there is an additional project for setting up a node js game server which sets a web interface with browser virtual joysticks allowing upto 8 players (snakes) on the cube. https://github.com/bishibashiB/js_game_manager_skeleton
